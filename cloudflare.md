##How it works?
Today 90% of users do not engage actively on websites. More than 75% people spend less than 10 seconds on your page. With an ever increasing bounce rate, it has been a loss of revenue for the website owners. 

By providing a user friendly interface, we help your existing audience spend more time on your website, increasing engagement while decreasing the bounce rate. Users do not have to scroll down to the article to engage but can engage from anywhere on your web page.
